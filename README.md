# Prediction-of-Reservoir-Dynamic-Scouring-and-Siltation-Topography-Based-on-Deep-Learning
This project aims to leverage deep learning technology to construct a model capable of accurately predicting the dynamic scouring and siltation topography of reservoirs, thereby providing a scientific basis for reservoir operation, flood control and disaster mitigation, and ecological environmental protection.
